## Why we are the team for the job
A pitch for a new landingpage for EduTechSmart.
We are the right people to build this landing page because we combine technical expertise with real user experience from the field.  
  
Some of us work directly in healthcare and education and know how the page will be used in practice. This gives us the ability to see the project from both sides â€“ as developers and as users.  
  
This insight allows us to create a page that is not only modern and technically solid, but also functional, clear, and trustworthy for the target groups EduTechSmart is addressing.

## Goals for the project

- Deliver a modern landingpage that shows a trustworthy way to educate healthcare workers.
- Present the product clearly.  
- Presented in a lighthearted and lively way.

## Design

- Built for mobile first.
- Modern effects.
- Soft and sleek borders.
- Modern colorscheme.
- Darkmode.
